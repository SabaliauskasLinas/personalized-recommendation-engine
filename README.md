# Personalized Betting Recommendation Engine MVP Plan

This document outlines the steps to implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a personalized betting recommendation engine using ML.NET. The system will use a player's betting history and personal details to generate tailored betting recommendations via a web API.

## 1. Define Data Structure and Collection
- **Objective**: Collect and structure user data and betting history for model training.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define user data schema: PlayerID (unique), Age, Country, Gender, RegistrationDate.
  - Define betting history schema: BetID, PlayerID, Sport, Tournament, Team, OddSelection, BetAmount, BetDate, Outcome (Win/Loss).
  - Define betting offerings schema: OfferID, Sport, Tournament, Team, Odds, EventDate.
  - Source synthetic or anonymized data for MVP (e.g., 1,000 users, 10,000 bets, focusing on one sport like soccer).
  - Store data in a relational database (e.g., SQLite for MVP simplicity).
- **Tools**: SQLite, CSV files for initial data import.
- **Notes**: Ensure data complies with privacy laws. Use anonymized data for testing.

## 2. Preprocess Data
- **Objective**: Clean and transform data for ML.NET model training.
- **Tasks**:
  - Clean data: Handle missing values (e.g., impute age with median), remove duplicates.
  - Feature engineering:
    - Numeric: Age, BetAmount, Odds.
    - Categorical: Encode Country, Gender, Sport, Tournament, Team (e.g., one-hot encoding).
    - Temporal: Extract BetDate features (e.g., day of week, recency).
  - Normalize/scale numeric features (e.g., MinMaxScaler in ML.NET).
  - Split data: 80% training, 20% testing.
- **Tools**: ML.NET DataFrame API, C# for preprocessing scripts.
- **Notes**: Save preprocessing pipeline for reuse in API.

## 3. Build and Train ML Model
- **Objective**: Train a recommendation model using ML.NET.
- **Tasks**:
  - Choose algorithm: Matrix Factorization for collaborative filtering (user-item interactions) or FastTree for regression-based ranking of betting options.
  - Input features: PlayerID, user demographics, betting history features.
  - Output: Predicted preference score for each betting option.
  - Train model using ML.NET pipeline:
    - Load data from SQLite.
    - Apply preprocessing (from step 2).
    - Train model with hyperparameter tuning (e.g., number of factors in matrix factorization).
  - Evaluate model: Use metrics like RMSE or precision@k for top-k recommendations.
- **Tools**: ML.NET, C# console app for training.
- **Notes**: Start with matrix factorization for simplicity. Save trained model to ONNX format.

## 4. Develop Web API
- **Objective**: Create a web API to serve personalized recommendations.
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up ASP.NET Core Web API project.
  - Implement endpoint: `GET /recommendations/{playerId}`.
    - Fetch player’s historical data (betting history, demographics) from database.
    - Fetch today’s betting offerings from database or external feed.
    - Load ML.NET model and preprocessing pipeline.
    - Generate top-k recommendations (e.g., top 5 betting options).
  - Return JSON response: List of recommended bets (OfferID, Sport, Tournament, Team, Odds).
  - Add basic authentication (e.g., API key) for security.
- **Tools**: ASP.NET Core, ML.NET for model inference, SQLite.
- **Notes**: Cache betting offerings to improve performance. Use dependency injection for model loading.

## 5. Deploy and Test
- **Objective**: Deploy the API and test the end-to-end system.
- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy API to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure App Service for MVP).
  - Test API with sample PlayerIDs and verify recommendations.
  - Monitor performance: Latency, recommendation relevance.
  - Validate data privacy and security measures.
- **Tools**: Azure, Postman for API testing.
- **Notes**: Log errors and monitor API usage for scalability planning.

## 6. Iterate and Refine
- **Objective**: Gather feedback and plan improvements.
- **Tasks**:
  - Collect user feedback on recommendation relevance.
  - Add more sports or betting types as data becomes available.
  - Experiment with hybrid models (collaborative + content-based).
  - Optimize API performance (e.g., caching, batch predictions).
- **Tools**: ML.NET, Azure Monitor for performance tracking.
- **Notes**: Plan for A/B testing to compare model versions.

## Timeline (Estimated)
- Week 1: Data collection and schema design.
- Week 2: Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Week 3: Model training and evaluation.
- Week 4: Web API development and integration.
- Week 5: Deployment and testing.
- Week 6: Feedback collection and iteration planning.

## Next Steps
- Deep dive into each step (e.g., specific ML.NET code, API implementation).
- Explore advanced features like real-time betting updates or user feedback loops.
- Scale to multiple sports and larger datasets.
